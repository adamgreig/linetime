# Firmware Outline/To-Do

* General
    * Timestamps for waves are currently the final entry but ideally would be
      the first entry - if you use the last waveform's timestamp for the next
      waveform you get this property, basically..
    * The ADC1 buffer is quite short, so probably a cycle that needs its RMS
      computing will find that after waiting for valid UTC the buffer now
      contains something quite different.
      Could make the buffer longer and either make the waveform structs longer
      too, or generate many of them, or instead could find the RMS inside the
      ISR (ew).
    * Timestamp the PPS signal so we can see how steady it is compared to PLL

* New Queue
    * Receive messages into queue instead of directly to microSD heap
    * Queue up say 16k worth of data and then try to send to server
    * If data can't be sent to server, save to SD card instead
    * Go through SD card once connection restored to find any non-uploaded
      files and upload them

* Ethernet:
    * Send out TCP packets (HTTP POST?) with buffer contents
    * HTTP to u-Blox AssistNow Online and send to ublox because hey why not
    * Horrible packet loss issue. Not sure what to do about it.

* Battery:
    * ADC3 to monitor charge current and battery voltage
    * Send values into queue
    * Cycle CE as required

* GUI
    * Add font rendering
    * Display current UTC time/date, difference to electric clock time,
      current mains frequency and RMS voltage and waveform,
      plus battery status, GPS status, network status, mains presence, etc
    * Disable LCD backlight when running off battery power

* Touch screen controller:
    * Worry about this much later
    * SPI streaming touch events
