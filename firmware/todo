# Firmware Outline/To-Do

* Technical Debt
    * Tidy up queue system and split out from microSD so ethernet can use it
    * Timestamps for waves are currently the final entry but ideally would be
      the first entry - if you use the last waveform's timestamp for the next
      waveform you get this property, basically..
    * The ADC1 buffer is quite short, so probably a cycle that needs its RMS
      computing will find that after waiting for valid UTC the buffer now
      contains something quite different.
      Could make the buffer longer and either make the waveform structs longer
      too, or generate many of them, or instead could find the RMS inside the
      ISR (ew).

* Ethernet:
    * Read MAC address from ROM
    * LWIP to send TCP packets
    * HTTP to u-Blox AssistNow Online and send to ublox because hey why not

* Battery:
    * ADC3 to monitor charge current and battery voltage
    * Cycle CE as required

* LCD:
    * Backlight PWM
    * SPI config/initialisation
    * TFT LCD peripheral
    * UI stuff...

* Sounder:
    * DAC to amp
    * Tone generation

* Touch screen controller:
    * Worry about this much later
    * SPI streaming touch events
